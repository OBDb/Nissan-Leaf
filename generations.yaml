    description: "The original Nissan Leaf was the first mass-market all-electric vehicle from a major manufacturer, featuring a distinctive hatchback design with unique styling elements including vertical taillights and a bulbous profile optimized for aerodynamics. Initially equipped with a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery providing approximately 73 miles of EPA-rated range, powering an 80 kW (107 hp) electric motor driving the front wheels. Interior accommodations included seating for five with a practical hatchback design and digital instrument cluster displaying EV-specific information. A significant update in 2013 improved efficiency and reduced charging times, while a 2016 refresh offered an optional 30 kWh battery extending range to about 107 miles. Throughout its production, the first-generation Leaf faced criticism for its battery degradation issues particularly in hot climates, lack of active thermal management for the battery, and limited range compared to conventional vehicles. Despite these challenges, it became the world's best-selling electric vehicle for several years, establishing Nissan as an early leader in mass-market EVs and helping to build charging infrastructure and consumer awareness of electric mobility. The first-generation Leaf pioneered features like smartphone connectivity for remote monitoring and climate control activation, and introduced many consumers to electric vehicle concepts like regenerative braking and public charging networks."

  - name: "Second Generation (ZE1)"

    end_year: null
    description: "The second-generation Nissan Leaf features more conventional styling aligned with Nissan's broader design language, incorporating the V-motion grille, boomerang-shaped lights, and floating roof design. Dimensionally similar to its predecessor but with a lower, wider stance and more aggressive appearance. Initially offered with a 40 kWh battery providing approximately 150 miles of EPA-rated range, powering a more potent 110 kW (147 hp) electric motor. In 2019, the Leaf Plus was introduced with a 62 kWh battery extending range to approximately 226 miles and increasing motor output to 160 kW (214 hp). The interior represents a significant upgrade with higher quality materials, more conventional layout, and modern technology including an available 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Advanced driver assistance features expanded with ProPILOT Assist offering semi-autonomous highway driving capability. The e-Pedal system allows for one-pedal driving through enhanced regenerative braking. While still lacking the liquid cooling system found in competitors' batteries, the second generation includes improved battery management and durability. Charging capabilities include standard 6.6 kW Level 2 AC charging and up to 100 kW DC fast charging using the CHAdeMO standard. The second-generation Leaf built upon the pioneering work of its predecessor with substantially improved range, performance, and features, though it faced increasing competition from new EV entrants offering greater range and faster charging capabilities. Despite more conventional styling compared to the original, it maintains distinctive EV elements while presenting a more mainstream appearance to appeal to broader consumer acceptance."
