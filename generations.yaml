generations:
  - name: "First Generation (ZE0)"
    start_year: 2010
    end_year: 2017
    description: "The original Nissan Leaf was the first mass-market all-electric vehicle from a major manufacturer, featuring a distinctive hatchback design with unique styling elements including vertical taillights and a bulbous profile optimized for aerodynamics. Production began on 22 October 2010 at the Oppama facility in Yokosuka, Japan. Initially equipped with a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery developed in collaboration with NEC, providing approximately 73 miles of EPA-rated range, powering an 80 kW (107 hp) electric motor driving the front wheels. Interior accommodations included seating for five with a practical hatchback design and digital instrument cluster displaying EV-specific information. A significant update in 2013 improved efficiency and reduced charging times, while a 2016 refresh offered an optional 30 kWh battery extending range to about 107 miles. Throughout its production, the first-generation Leaf faced criticism for its battery degradation issues particularly in hot climates, lack of active thermal management for the battery, and limited range compared to conventional vehicles. Despite these challenges, it became the world's best-selling electric vehicle for several years, establishing Nissan as an early leader in mass-market EVs and helping to build charging infrastructure and consumer awareness of electric mobility. The first-generation Leaf pioneered features like smartphone connectivity for remote monitoring and climate control activation, and introduced many consumers to electric vehicle concepts like regenerative braking and public charging networks."

  - name: "Second Generation (ZE1)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: 2025
    description: "The second-generation Nissan Leaf features more conventional styling aligned with Nissan's broader design language, incorporating the V-motion grille, boomerang-shaped lights, and floating roof design. Launched in October 2017 for the 2018 model year, with deliveries in North America and Europe beginning in February 2018. Production ended in June 2025. Dimensionally similar to its predecessor but with a lower, wider stance and more aggressive appearance. Initially offered with a 40 kWh battery providing approximately 150 miles of EPA-rated range, powering a more potent 110 kW (147 hp) electric motor. In 2019, the Leaf Plus was introduced with a 62 kWh battery extending range to approximately 226 miles and increasing motor output to 160 kW (214 hp). The interior represents a significant upgrade with higher quality materials, more conventional layout, and modern technology including an available 8-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Advanced driver assistance features expanded with ProPILOT Assist offering semi-autonomous highway driving capability. The e-Pedal system allows for one-pedal driving through enhanced regenerative braking. In June 2022, the Leaf received a facelift for the 2023 model year. While still lacking the liquid cooling system found in competitors' batteries, the second generation includes improved battery management and durability. Charging capabilities include standard 6.6 kW Level 2 AC charging and up to 100 kW DC fast charging using the CHAdeMO standard. The second-generation Leaf built upon the pioneering work of its predecessor with substantially improved range, performance, and features, though it faced increasing competition from new EV entrants offering greater range and faster charging capabilities."

  - name: "Third Generation (ZE2)"
    start_year: 2025
    end_year: null
    description: "The third-generation Nissan Leaf represents a significant departure from its predecessors, adopting a subcompact crossover-style body built on the Renault-Nissan AmpR Medium platform (formerly CMF-EV), shared with the larger Nissan Ariya. Unveiled on 17 June 2025, with production beginning in June 2025. This generation marks the first time the Leaf features active liquid-cooled battery packs instead of passive air-cooled systems. The new design delivers substantial improvements in range, with EPA-rated estimates up to 303 miles compared to the previous model's 149-212 miles. Available with 52 kWh (174 hp) or 75 kWh (214 hp) NMC lithium-ion battery options, both with thermal conditioning functionality. The Leaf maintains a single-motor, front-wheel-drive layout without dual-motor AWD options. Charging capabilities include 150 kW DC charging, and the new Leaf becomes the first Nissan vehicle to adopt the North American Charging System (NACS), providing compatibility with Tesla Supercharger network in North America. In North America, the J1772 port supports Level 2 charging on the driver's side front fender, while the NACS port is on the passenger's side. The aerodynamic drag coefficient is reduced to 0.25 (0.26 in North America) compared to the previous generation's 0.29. Availability is confirmed for North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia, with manufacturing in Japan at Kaminokawa, Tochigi and in the United Kingdom at Sunderland."
