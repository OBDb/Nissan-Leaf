    description: "The first-generation Nissan Leaf was the world's first mass-market battery electric vehicle from a major manufacturer, unveiled on 1 August 2009. Production began on 22 October 2010 at the Oppama facility in Yokosuka, Japan, with European and US models initially imported from this plant until early 2013. Battery production began at the Smyrna plant on 12 December 2012, with official US production starting on 9 January 2013. UK manufacturing began on 28 March 2013. The Leaf featured a distinctive 5-door hatchback design with a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery pack (192 flat, laminated cells developed with NEC) providing approximately 73 miles of EPA-rated range, powering an 80 kW electric motor. The battery pack was located under the floor and between the wheels, optimizing handling and interior space. Recharging took 16 hours on 120V or 8 hours on 230V, with fast charging restoring 80% capacity in approximately 30 minutes. The first generation garnered praise for its spacious cargo area and standard heated seats, but criticism for inexpensive interior materials and battery degradation concerns in hot climates due to the lack of active thermal management. Despite challenges, it became the world's best-selling electric vehicle from 2011 to 2014 and again in 2016, establishing Nissan as a pioneer in mass-market EVs."

    end_year: 2025
    description: "The second-generation Nissan Leaf launched in October 2017 for the 2018 model year, with deliveries beginning in North America and Europe in February 2018. Stylistically, it marked a major departure with more conventional design language including the V-motion grille, boomerang-shaped lights, and floating roof. Initially offered with a 40 kWh battery pack (39 kWh usable) providing an EPA-rated range of approximately 150 miles, powering an 110 kW electric motor producing 236 lb-ft of torque. Charging options included a 6.6 kW regular plug (SAE J1772 in US/Japan, Type 2 in EU) and 50 kW CHAdeMO fast charging. The interior added Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. From 2019, the Leaf e+ (Leaf Plus in North America) variant offered a larger 62 kWh battery (59 kWh usable) providing approximately 226 miles of EPA range, paired with a more powerful 160 kW motor and up to 100 kW CHAdeMO fast charging. ProPILOT Assist, a lane-centering system with automatic parking capability, was available on higher trims. The e-Pedal system enabled one-pedal driving through enhanced regenerative braking. In June 2022, the Leaf received a facelift for the 2023 model year, with EPA range slightly reduced to 149 miles for the 40 kWh version and 212 miles for the 62 kWh version. UK production ceased in March 2024 after 270,000 units produced at the Sunderland plant across both generations. Global production ended in June 2025."

  - name: "Second Generation (ZE1) Facelift"
    start_year: 2023
    end_year: 2025
    description: "The June 2022 facelift for the 2023 model year brought exterior and interior updates to the second-generation Leaf. The EPA range was slightly reduced compared to pre-facelift models, with the 40 kWh version rated at 149 miles and the 62 kWh Leaf Plus at 212 miles. The facelift maintained the same mechanical layout and powertrain options while introducing updated styling elements consistent with Nissan's then-current design language. Production continued alongside the third-generation ZE2 model for a brief overlap period before concluding in June 2025."

  - name: "Third Generation (ZE2)"
    start_year: 2025
    end_year: null
    description: "The third-generation Nissan Leaf was unveiled on 17 June 2025, representing a significant departure from its predecessors by adopting a subcompact crossover-style body built on the Renault-Nissan AmpR Medium platform (formerly CMF-EV), shared with the Nissan Ariya. This generation marks the first time the Leaf features active liquid-cooled battery packs instead of the passive air-cooled systems used previously. Two NMC lithium-ion battery options are available: a 52 kWh battery paired with a motor producing 174 hp, and a 75 kWh battery paired with a 214 hp motor. EPA-rated range is estimated up to 303 miles on select configurations, with European versions offering approximately 285 miles at steady speeds. Charging capabilities include 150 kW DC fast charging, making it the first Nissan vehicle to adopt the North American Charging System (NACS) for Tesla Supercharger compatibility. In North America, the J1772 port is on the driver's side front fender for Level 2 charging, while the NACS port is on the passenger side. The drag coefficient is reduced to 0.25 (0.26 in North America) compared to the previous generation's 0.29. The Leaf retains a single-motor, front-wheel-drive layout without dual-motor AWD options. Availability is confirmed for North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia, with manufacturing in Japan at Kaminokawa, Tochigi and the UK at Sunderland."
