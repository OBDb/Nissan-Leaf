## Generations

The Nissan Leaf has gone through three generations, each bringing significant improvements in range, technology, and design:

- **First Generation (2010-2017)**: The original Nissan Leaf was one of the first mass-produced all-electric vehicles. Initial models featured a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery providing around 73-75 miles of range (EPA). Later models received battery upgrades to 30 kWh, extending range to approximately 107 miles. This generation established the Leaf as a pioneering EV with its compact five-door hatchback design and zero-emission performance.

- **Second Generation (2018-2022)**: The second-generation Leaf featured a complete redesign with more conventional styling, improved aerodynamics, and substantially increased performance. The base model came with a 40 kWh battery providing about 150 miles of range, while the Leaf Plus variant offered a 62 kWh battery extending range to approximately 226 miles. This generation introduced ProPILOT Assist driver assistance technology and the e-Pedal one-pedal driving system.

- **Third Generation (2023-present)**: The latest generation Leaf builds upon the second generation with refined styling, improved battery technology, and enhanced connectivity features. Battery options continue to include both standard and extended range versions, with further improvements in efficiency and charging capabilities. This generation features upgraded interior materials, expanded driver assistance systems, and more sophisticated infotainment options to keep pace with the competitive EV market.
